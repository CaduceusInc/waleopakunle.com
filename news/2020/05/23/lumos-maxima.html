<h1 id="previously-in-the-ai-field">Previously in the AI field…</h1>

<p>Hey folks, I am back with a recap of last week in AI! This week, I decided to add on a new section, based on feedback from a fellow data scientist. Be sure to check out the “Job” section for a highlight of some opportunities that are open for machine learning practitioners.</p>

<p>Working on feedback from last week, all links now open in new tabs. I will be implementing that for all links going forward. Thanks for the feedback, and I hope you enjoy a better reading experience.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset" target="_blank">Flickr 30k Dataset</a>: The Flickr 30k dataset has over 30,000 images, and each image is labeled with different captions. This dataset is used to build an image caption generator. And this dataset is an upgraded version of Flickr 8k used to build more accurate models.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Possible project idea</strong>:  You can train a deep learning model that is capable of analysing and extracting features from the image and generate as English sentence that describes the image. Next time when your friend send you an image and goes, “Caption this”, you can ask your model what it thinks and get back to your friend with the machine caption.</p>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/katanaml/katana-assistant/blob/master/mlbackend/intents.json" target="_blank">Chatbot Intents Dataset</a>
The dataset for a chatbot is a JSON file that has disparate tags like goodbye, greetings, pharmacy_search, hospital_search, etc. Every tag has a list of patterns that a user can ask, and the chatbot will respond according to that pattern. The dataset is perfect for understanding how chatbot data works.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Possible Project Idea</strong>: You can build a chatbot or understand the working of a chatbot by modifying and expanding the data with your observations. To build a Chatbot of your own, you need to have a good knowledge of Natural language processing concepts.
<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/python-chatbot-project-build-your-first-python-pro" target="_blank">This article</a> from DZone could help you get started with that.</p>

The Mall customers dataset holds the details about people visiting the mall. The dataset has an age, customer id, gender, annual income, and spending score. It gains insights from the data and divides the customers into different groups based on their behaviors.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Possible Project Idea</strong>: Segment the customers based on their gender, age, interest. It is useful in customized marketing. Customer segmentation is an important practice of dividing customers based on individual groups that are similar.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Project Idea</strong>: Video classification can be done by using the dataset, and the model can describe what video is about. A video takes a series of inputs to classify in which category the video belongs. This would be a rather involved project, but if you are interested, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08675v1.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a> could help get you started, along with the following implementations:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“… It is therefore surprising that the western misconception that China lacks debate around AI ethics seems to prevail, when in fact: i) existing Chinese AI principles largely align with global ones; ii) Chinese discussions enjoy unprecedented government support; and iii) the country is already investigating the technical and social implementation of these principles by exploring how they interact with its distinct cultural heritage.
In this essay I explore AI ethics in China through the lens of some of the key topics discussed in depth in the other essays on this collection – education, healthcare, smart cities and social credit systems – to consider which, if any, ethical issues are unique to China and which should be seen as global concerns.” - Danit Gal, <em>Technology advisor to the UN Secretary General’s High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation and associate fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence at the University</em></p>

I merely provide comments on the code and an intuition of how to minimally customize the set up. This group of researchers present a system to help designers create icons that are widely used in banners, signboards, billboards, homepages, and mobile apps. Designers are tasked with drawing contours and then, the system colourizes contours in different styles. This goal is achieved by training a dual conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) on the collected icon dataset.

The model is suffering from acute overfitting as you can see from the loss logs. This was initially meant to be a video tutorial series on how to deploy deep learning models in production, but I wont be completing the video shoot until I get the accuracy up a lot higher than it currently is. This week, I will be tuning hyperparameters and retraining the model. Problem is, it takes too friggin long! Just training on 4 classes took an hour per epoch. I’ll have to look into options to reduce training time as well. Once that headache is done, I’ll be sharing how you can put the model into a flask application, deploy its docker image and manage it with kubernetes.</p>

  <li>Air Force ‘Skyborg’ AI powered drones to take flight alongside warplanes by 2023, because apparently ‘Skynet’ was copyrighted.
    <blockquote>
      <p>The  U.S. Air Force is soliciting the aerospace industry to provide flyable “Skyborg” drones by 2023. The drones will be powered by artificial intelligence, capable of taking off, landing, and performing missions on their own.
Skyborg will not only free manned pilots from dangerous and dull missions but allow the Air Force to add legions of new, unpiloted, cheap planes…<a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a32631612/skyborg-drones-2023/?source=nl&amp;utm_source=nl_pop&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;date=052220&amp;utm_campaign=nl20376989&amp;src=nl&amp;utm_source=reddit.com" target="_blank">Read more</a>.</p>

It’s no news that hackers are now taking advantage of machine learning.
Cyberattacks have become part of the modern way of life, with companies investing billions of dollars to protect their data from hackers. As ways to secure systems have become more advanced and innovative, so too have the means of attack. Following the 2017 ‘worms’ attack by WannaCry and NotPetya, which bypassed firewalls and crippled thousands of organisations, companies have turned to AI in order to provide greater protection. Machine algorithms have the advantage of speed and are less labour intensive than traditional security models. However, hackers are now also leveraging ML in order to develop more sophisticated modes of attack. They are employing malicious algorithms that have the ability to evade detection by adapting, learning, and continuously improving. AI-led attacks look likely to feature in the future, with a recent study by Forrester revealing that 88% of security professionals expect AI-driven attacks to become mainstream.</li>

<p><strong>Why this is important?</strong>:</p>

  <p>“…Only AI can fight AI.”</p>

<p>With new threats on the horizon, the industry will have to adapt in order to defend itself. Companies are already shifting towards more ‘offensive AI’ systems and we are likely to see even more developments as people fight to protect their most valuable resource - data.</p>

A group of researchers has developed a way for artificial neuronal networks to communicate with biological neuronal networks. The new development is a big step forward for neuroprosthetic devices, which replace damaged neurons with artificial neuronal circuitry.</p>

<p>The new method relies on the conversion of artificial electrical spiking signals to a visual pattern. That is then used, via optogenetic stimulation, in order to entrain the biological neurons.</p>
