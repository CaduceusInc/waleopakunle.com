# The newest freebies in the AI field.

Hello folks! It's my sincere pleasure to bring to you the latest news of happenings in the AI space. In this post, I will be going over the latest opensource tools, startups, coolest projects and more! So, if you are as fascinated with this field as much as I am, I suggest you grab a coffee and stick around to find out what's been going down!

First of all, as an orderly creature, I am going to break down the discussion into several sections, I'll be going over:


1. Openource Tools

1. Cool AI Projects

1. New AI startups

1. Great articles

1. AI Events

1. AI Books

1. Personal Engagements

## Opensource tools:
1. Detectron2: A PyTorch based modular object detection library. They made it available as a library so it can just be imported into your project. This is a really cool way to make an opensource contribution!
Detectron2 has new features such as panoptic segmentation, densepose, Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, etc. You can read more about it on their [blog](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-detectron2-a-pytorch-based-modular-object-detection-library-/) or check out the [code base](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2).

1. EfficientNet Collection: Google has released a collection of EfficientNet models which are an order of magnitude smaller and faster than previous models previously used for the object detection task. You can find the models [here on Tf Hub](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/efficientnet/1).

1. Codespaces: GitHub just added a new feature folks! You can now write code on Github just like you would on a VS Code editor! With this cool feature, you can code, build, test, debug, and deploy with a complete development environment in your browser. There's also a plugin for codespaces in VS Code. Seriously, you should check it out and request for early access. You see, it's still in beta stage. You can do so [here](https://github.com/features/codespaces/).

1. Qualcom has opensourced their AI Model Efficiency Toolkit! This is in their bid to provide a simple library plugin for AI developers to utilize for state-of-the-art model efficiency performance and to make artificial intelligence ubiquitous across devices, machines, vehicles, and things. Check out their [blog post](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2020/05/04/open-sourcing-ai-model-efficiency-toolkit?cmpid=oofyus194234&linkId=87923665) and the [code base](https://github.com/quic/aimet) for the installation guide, user guide and API documentation.
