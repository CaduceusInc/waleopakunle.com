# <u>How to help your company adopt artificial intelligence</u>.

## Introduction

As the intense hype about artificial intelligence begins to wane, companies have passed the threshold of asking exciting questions about AI to looking for results. Rather than asking the hype-fed questions, they are beginning to ask the questions that really matter:

> What exactly is the *business value* of adopting artificial intelligence for *my* organization?
>
> How do we go about implementing it?
>
> What will it *cost* us? 

These are very important questions. They are the kinds of questions that directly affect a business and their profit goals. 

A huge majority of companies, at least in Nigeria, are not adopting artificial intelligence in day to day activities. Sadly, this includes a large majority of companies currently purporting to be doing so. The few that *are* exploring use cases in AI are doing so in capacities that only begin to scratch the surface of what AI is currently capable of accomplishing.

This is understandable. While the barriers of entry into the fairly new field have been brought incredibly low, they are neither non-existent nor trivial. They require a tremendous amount of investment, in the form of technical know how resources and potentially tremendous compute expenses. For companies who rely on profits for their existence, dabbling into unfamiliar waters without a captain with the know-how to guide the flow of a dedicated team, leaves them exposed to risk of plunging into an abyss of not making enough profit to stay afloat.



## Adoption Roadblocks

There are several problems that hinder companies attempting to adopt AI in their organizations. I have thought about some of these hinderances that foster this situation and will discuss the ones I find most crucial below. Some of them include:

* Acute shortage of actionable data.
* Lack of understanding of AI intricacies, especially among non-technical staff.
* Shortage of AI and non-AI domain specialists.
* Orchestration issues.
* Resistance to change.
* Business alignment.



1. Data shortage.

   Well, this just had to come first because data is King, and the King needs it chow. As I am sure you have heard by now, an AI system is only as good as the quantity, quality and sometimes, the explainability of the data. 
   
   AI algorithms are data guzzlers! No jokes. In some cases, such as training of some specific GANs and a handful of other algorithms, less data fed into the system actually helps, but I assure you, this is the exception, not the norm. More often than not, you will require A LOT of training data in order for your system to learn patterns that can be meaningful to us.
