<p>On a recent Tuesday, I was taking a break from my rigorous work schedule to check in on LinkedIn. I had received a message on LinkedIn from a startup founder. He wanted insights into some of the valuable skills I had picked up in my work as a data scientist at my current place of employment.</p>

<p>I immediately remembered this draft I had lying dormant in my draft collection and had been meaning to get out there. Unfortunately, I haven’t heard back from said founder regarding the ‘interview’ and so I decided to put this article out there for whoever may find these insights valuable.</p>

<p>While advancing your knowledge of artificial intelligence, it is not unusual to get caught up in learning loops. Or even worse, to burn candles at both ends because you’re buried in research papers, tutorials, projects, or whatever is currently catching your fancy. This is especially so if you are like me and have very wide and sometimes conflicting interests. To be honest, I still get caught up in this loop and go very long hours without sleep.</p>

<p>Lucky for me, I did not learn this lesson the hard way. I started coming across stories of very young folks, some of whom I know personally, who were overworking themselves in the name of passion and had unfortunately suffered breakdowns of various degrees.</p>

<p>I realized that it is physically impossible to keep up with all the happenings in the field of artificial intelligence, irrespective of the passion you have for the field. Depriving myself of the necessary sleep my body requires just wasn’t helping me stay ahead of the research curve And how could it? Every single day, there are hundreds (if not thousands at this point) of AI-related research papers being churned out.</p>

<p>I had to rationalize it to my overzealous mind this way because I was accustomed to staying up for 2-3 days on end (powered by my faithful black coffee), just poring through dense materials and hiding from society like a caveman.</p>

<p>Although the detrimental effects of this action were not immediately obvious in my body, evidence of the most probable eventual outcome abounded around me. It is important to remember, as a good friend of mine says:</p>

<h2 id="rewards-follow-value">Rewards follow value.</h2>

<p>In my first year as a practicing data scientist, I had dreams that once I amassed enough knowledge relevant to data science, and proved that I had that knowledge with a few technical projects to back up my claims, I would eventually be noticed by some “mega organization”, who would then proceed to provide me with all the GPU machines at their disposal for me to work my magic. I am usually a very rational person, but somehow this did not seem impossible. After all, I was becoming grounded in what has been dubbed the “sexiest job of the century”.</p>

<p>Well, the reality in the field is that you get rewarded for the kind/quality of the value you can provide to whoever has the resources to compensate you. Furthermore, to provide value, you must cater to the needs of whoever is compensating. What do I mean? Well, I am glad that you asked.</p>

<p>You see, most organizations, except maybe non-profits, go into business to make a profit. To do that there are several hurdles and difficulties that they must surmount so that they can break even or even stay in business. It is very unlikely that a Fintech (for example) is gonna throw funds at your feet because you claim you know how to make a picture of President Buhari read a speech written by the outgoing President Trump using a <a href="https://github.com/shaoanlu/faceswap-GAN" target="_blank">face-swapping deepfake</a>.</p>

<p>Unless the company is in the entertainment industry and this particular use case correlates with their business goals, they are unlikely to throw money at you for your knowledge. The formula here is to find the company’s pain points, find a use case they can leverage to overcome their difficulty, and then implement a version of it. In most cases, whatever you develop doesn’t even need to be perfect or at it’s most “cost-effective” phase. As long as it works and the value to the business is evident, you most likely have a winner, depending on what your intentions are.</p>

<p>In summary, projects should be undertaken while keeping business value in mind. How will this project add value? Who does it help? Who needs this fix you’re working on? Is it solving a problem or highlighting one? Does it make a process easier by maybe automating it?</p>

<p>Time and energy are quite limited. Unless you’re more interested in theoretical knowledge (which is perfectly okay by the way), you are better off embarking on a project that could lead you to some cheddar.</p>

<h2 id="manage-expectations">Manage expectations</h2>

<p>While thinking about this, I thought this may be limited to the tech ecosystem I currently find myself in. However, I concluded that it is a general lesson albeit the spectrum of impact may vary based on the tech ecosystem the reader is in.</p>

<p>You see, the technology industry in Nigeria is several steps behind what is obtainable in many other parts of the world as a direct consequence of the acute drought of investment in the infrastructure and policies needed to make technologies like AI to thrive, but more on that some other time. Due to these hurdles though, the country is severely lacking in terms of the adoption of artificial intelligence. Don’t get me wrong. The hype around Artificial Intelligence is here. It’s everywhere. But the pool of companies that know what to do with the technology and actually groom dedicated teams to do so leaves a lot to be desired. This could lead to a scenario where you are hired as an Data Scientist, only to find yourself working as a regular backend developer with an occasional data science project if you’re lucky.</p>

<p>In the same vein, there is a lot of hype around what AI can currently do. This is a global phenomenon. While AI research has advanced incredibly in the past demi-decade and there are a lot of incredible tasks which AI can solve with super human accuracy, the capabilities of most “state of the art models” are not at the level where they can be generalized for use in plug-and-play situations in business settings. They usually require varying levels of customization to specific problems and building maintainable software solutions around them. While machine learning maturity in enterprise is gradually increasing, this is still not a trivial task in 2020.</p>

<p>In a survey conducted by <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45344519&amp;utm_medium=rss_feed&amp;utm_source=Alert&amp;utm_campaign=rss_syndication" target="_blank">International Data Corporation (IDC)</a> in 2019, which consisted of 2,473 business decison makers, they found that of the organizations already using AI, only 25% have developed an “enterprise-wide” AI strategy, and it found that among those in the process of deploying AI, a substantial number of projects are doomed to fail. Respondents to the survey identified skills shortages and unrealistic expectations as the top two reasons for failure, in fact, with a full quarter reporting up to 50% failure rate. Other culprits impeding AI adoption internally in the firms included cost of building and maintaining AI solutions, lack of qualified workers, and biased data.</p>

<p>A more recent survey by <a href="https://algorithmia.com/state-of-ml" target="_blank">Algorithmia</a> (2020) shows that while adoption of AI has definitely soared this year, very little has changed in the success rate ratio.</p>

<p>Don’t let this discourage you by any means though. There are a lot of quick wins out there that hinge on the right application of artificial intelligence and lots of testimonies to back this up too. My message here is that it is not easy or a straightforward process as of 2020.</p>
