## **Introduction**

{% include embed_image.html content= "/images/me.jpg" %}

Hi there! My name is Wale Opakunle.
I am a deep learning practitioner, data engineer and data journalist.
Other times, I am just a learning machine confounded by the velocity at which the tech space is accelerating.

I reside in Lagos, Nigeria and I have a first degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Lagos, right down by the Lagos lagoon.

It is my deepest desire that I create an awareness of the possibilities that developments in artificial intelligence affords us and by so doing, infect as many as possible within my community with this passion and knowledge, that we may bring about the change we so much desire to see in my country, for ourselves and for posterity.

## **Vision for my blog**

In light of the above, my blog is dedicated to do the following:

1. Discuss State of The Art (SOTA) research papers within my field of interest, their implementations as well as possible impacts they could have if harnessed in Nigeria.

1. Discuss projects I work on that could be helpful to the community.

1. Discuss the various advances in Artificial Intelligence.

1. Spurn the audience to contribute to building AI tools (based on all discussions above) for the improvement of Nigeria.

1. Contribute to the decentralization and dissemination of AI knowledge in Nigeria.

Should our interests and passions align, and you wish to collaborate, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
