# Valuable skills I've picked up in my data science journey

On a recent Tuesday, I was taking a break from my rigorous work schedule to check in on LinkedIn. I had received a message on LinkedIn from a startup founder. He wanted insights into some of the valuable skills I had picked up in my work as a data scientist at my current place of employment.

I immediately remembered this draft I had lying dormant in my draft collection and had been meaning to get out there. Unfortunately, I haven't heard back from said founder regarding the 'interview' and so I am putting this article out there for whoever may find these insights valuable.

Without further ado, let's get to it!

## More haste less speed

While advancing your knowledge of artificial intelligence, it is not unusual to get caught up in learning loops. Or even worse, to burn candles at both ends because you're buried in research papers, tutorials, projects, or whatever is currently catching your fancy. To be honest, I still get caught up in this loop and go very long hours without sleep.
