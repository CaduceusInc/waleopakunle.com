<p>Tuesday.</p>

<p>I’m sitting here on a workday, at 3am, considering a lot of things.</p>

<p>First of all, I am wondering how I managed to make it to 3am while wide awake. I’d made a commitment to be asleep by no later than midnigt today. There are some sleepy battles that black coffee just wont fight these days.</p>

<p>My eyes wondered to my phone’s screen and I notice the receipt for my purchse of this domain name. I then remember how long it took me to set this platform up; the sentiment behinf it all bacj then… I inevitably succumb to nostaligia. I miss writing. I miss sharing what I learn and chalenging myself to find out even more just because of the thril and rush this brings me. The satisfying feeling of transfering information and creating understanding.</p>

<p>You see, I have been meaning to write. I have spent what must be countless hours ruminating on what to talk about in 2020, but the trut is this has been quite a year and it has left it’s historical imprint upon us all.</p>

<p>2020.</p>

<p>What a year. (Probably a story for another day?)</p>

<p>I am starting a new writing style experiment that I hope will lead me to write more.
I will write out all my drafts in the public eye of the internet and give myself an ultimatum to get it done.</p>

<p>I am too sleep deprived to work out the details right now, but this is my initial post for said experiment.</p>

<p>TBC….</p>
